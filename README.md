Data visualization using HTML &amp; CSS.

# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Overview

Data is more powerful when we can easily share it with others. I've visualized a dataset of more than 500 cities, where I've anlayzed and plotted mutliple weather factors against latitude.

In this exercise, I used Python & Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to convert the data from CSV to HTML. I then built the various pages using HTML and styled the dashboard/website with CSS.
